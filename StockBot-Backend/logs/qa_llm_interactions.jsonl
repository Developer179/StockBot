Unfortunately, I can't provide you with a specific list of \"future profitable stocks.\"  Predicting the future performance of any stock is impossible; market conditions, unforeseen events, and company-specific factors can all dramatically impact a stock's price and profitability.  Any list claiming to guarantee future profits would be misleading.\n\nInstead of offering specific stock recommendations, which would be irresponsible, I can suggest resources and strategies that may help you in your own research to identify potentially promising companies:\n\n* **Fundamental Analysis:** This involves examining a company's financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement) to assess its financial health, profitability, and growth prospects.  Look for indicators like strong revenue growth, increasing profit margins, and a healthy balance sheet.\n\n* **Technical Analysis:** This focuses on chart patterns and trading volume to identify potential price trends. While not a predictor of future profitability, it can help you time your entry and exit points.\n\n* **Industry Research:**  Understanding industry trends and identifying companies well-positioned to benefit from those trends can be crucial.  Look for industries with strong growth potential.\n\n* **Company Management:**  A strong and experienced management team is a key indicator of future success. Research the backgrounds and track records of the company's leadership.\n\n* **Diversification:**  Never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your portfolio across different sectors and asset classes can help mitigate risk.\n\n\nRemember, investing in the stock market always carries risk.  Conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any company, and consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor.  They can help you create a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.\n", "h": null, "ref": null, "int": "final"}

This will narrow your focus.\n* **Conduct thorough due diligence:** Research individual companies within your chosen area, considering factors like financial performance (revenue, earnings, debt), future growth prospects, management quality, and competitive landscape.\n* **Consider diversification:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Diversifying across multiple energy companies can reduce your overall risk.\n* **Use reputable financial resources:** Consult financial news websites, brokerage research reports, and company filings to inform your decision-making.\n* **Seek professional advice:** A financial advisor can help you create a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.\n\nRemember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and all investments carry risk.

The price difference between the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) for the same stock is usually negligible and temporary.
